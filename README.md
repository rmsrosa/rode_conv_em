This is a companion repository, with all the code for the simulations presented in the article "Strong order-one convergence of the Euler method for random ordinary differential equations driven by semi-martingale noises", by Peter E. Kloeden and Ricardo M. S. Rosa.

Just check the [Documentation](https://rmsrosa.github.io/rode_convergence_euler/).

For reproducing the examples appearing in the paper, you can run the code locally by following the instructions in the [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) file.
