## Overview

These are companion notes for the paper "Strong order 1 convergence of the Euler method for random ordinary differential equations", by Peter E. Kloeden and Ricardo M. S. Rosa.

We briefly review the main results of the paper and reveal the numerical codes used in the examples presented in the paper.

The code is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) and heavily depends on the packages provided by the [SciML ecosystem](https://sciml.ai).
